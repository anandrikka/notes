# Introduction

Lately, I'm feeling terrible. I'm under the constant feeling of falling behind with all the latest developments happening in web development. The last time I learned something new was almost 6 years back.&#x20;

I'm currently working on React, Ruby & Rails, MYSQL, and AWS and I'm very much comfortable with what I'm doing, that's exactly why I'm not liking :disappointed::disappointed::angry:

I have 11 years of experience and I don't know anything about Algorithms and Data structures and I feel ashamed. So for the next, whatever time it takes I want to get myself comfortable with the following:

:dart: Data Structures and Algorithms

:dart: Java (Spring)

:dart: AWS

:dart: DevOps (Docker, Deployments, etc...)

:dart: AWS (Associate Architect Certification) :dart:

:dart: Terraform (Maybe...) :pray:

I chose git books as it felt like the right choice for me as I don't want to maintain any kind of static sites and want to keep track of my progress.

I will try to log the progress every day as much as possible.

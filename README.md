# Introduction

It's been a while since I blogged, I usually like to keep track of notes and stuff for my reference in an online blog.

I'm a web developer and my main goal is to keep myself updated and get familiar with new technologies and frameworks.

I'm currently working on React, Ruby & Rails, MYSQL, and AWS.

I'm in a comfort zone and I'm not liking it :disappointed::disappointed::angry:

Whatever the time it takes I want to get myself comfortable with the following:

* Java + Spring
* AWS
* DevOps (Docker, Deployments, etc...)
* AWS (Associate Architect Certification) :dart:
* Terraform (Maybe...) :pray:

I chose git books as it felt like the right choice for me as I don't want to maintain any kind of static sites and want to keep track of my progress.

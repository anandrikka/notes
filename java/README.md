# Introduction

It's been a while since I worked on a real Java project. The last Java version I used was 6, which was very long ago. Java has always been close to my heart, as this is my first programming language as a developer. I tried to get on board with the latest versions but could never start learning seriously.

I have decided to come up to speed with all the latest features of Java and get familiar with the Spring framework in the next three months.

I plan to go through all the new features of Java starting from 8 to 21 and cover the most commonly asked interview questions, then go through the spring framework basics and a couple of additional frameworks including Spring Boot, and JPA, and then do a real-time project of creating a website using angular as frontend, java as backend and MySQL as database.

Additionally, I'm going to focus on building Java applications, loading libraries, using docker, etc...&#x20;
